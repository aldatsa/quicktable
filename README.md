###A quicktable plugin for ckeditor 4

This plugin adds a quicktable feature to the existing table plugin.

The original code was submitted by danyaPostfactum as a pull request for the table plugin. I just extracted the code and made a seperate plugin out of it and added some options to it (see sample in plugin directory)

The original table plugin is required for this to work!
